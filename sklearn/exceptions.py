class DataConversionWarning(UserWarning):

    This warning occurs when some input data needs to be converted or
    interpreted in a way that may not match the user's expectations.

    For example, this warning may occur when the user
        - passes an integer array to a function which expects float input and
          will convert the input
        - requests a non-copying operation, but a copy is required to meet the
          implementation's data-type expectations;
        - passes an input whose shape can be interpreted ambiguously.

    --------
    >>> from sklearn.utils import validation

    >>> from sklearn.exceptions import DataConversionWarning
